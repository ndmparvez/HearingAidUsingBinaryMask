# Implementation of Hearing Aid using Binary Masking

>## Overview
>> Hearing impaired listeners find more difficulty in distinguishing speech in noisy environments as compared to persons with normal hearing. While using correct hearing devices hearing impaired listeners find it difficult in interpreting speech. . Approximately 10% of the world's population suffers from some type of hearing loss, yet only a small percentage of this statistic use a hearing aid. The stigma associated with wearing a hearing aid, customer dissatisfaction with hearing aid performance, and the cost associated with a high performance solution are all causes of low market penetration the use of digital signal processing, digital hearing aid now offers what the analog hearing aid cannot offer. The existing methods used in available speech algorithms gives better results for quality of speech signal. While clarity of speech will give poor performance. Because of this hearing impaired listeners having problems in communication.
>>This speech intelligibility problem is significantly removed by using binary mask algorithm.
>>This proposed method is suitable for hearing aid application. Time frequency masking technique is introduced in this algorithm. Time frequency masks often take the values of ’zero’ and ’one’, resulting in mixture of two signals. Binary mask is calculated in classification stage and noise signal is removed.
